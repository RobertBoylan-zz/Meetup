# Meetup
Calculates the actual meetup date of a meetup given a description of a meetup date.

Examples of general descriptions are:

The first Monday of January 2019
The third Tuesday of January 2019
The wednesteenth of January 2019
The last Thursday of January 2019

Note that "monteenth", "tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There was a meetup whose members realized that there are exactly 7 numbered days in a month that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth' in every month.

Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor calculate the date of the actual meetup. For example, if given "The first Monday of January 2019", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/7.
